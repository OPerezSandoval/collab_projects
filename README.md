# Collab Python Projects

This repo is a shared space where we work together on small to medium-sized Python projects to sharpen our skills, explore new libraries, and solve fun or useful problems. The goal is consistent practice, learning by doing, and sharing knowledge as we go.

## Purpose

- Practice core Python concepts and real-world applications
- Collaborate on code reviews and pair programming
- Explore modules, packages, APIs, and automation
- Build a habit of clean, readable, and well-documented code

## Structure

Each project has its own folder with a README explaining:
- The goal of the project
- Requirements
- How to run it
- What we learned
